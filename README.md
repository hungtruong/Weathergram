Weathergram
----------
Weathergram is a Twilio project that won 1st place in a contest. It was a total hack, but I'm posting it online in case anyone is curious how it works.

It uses the [Twilio API](http://www.twilio.com/docs) along with the [Weather Underground API](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) to grab a forecast, then plays songs corresponding to the returned conditions.

Usage
---------
- Place this directory in your web server root. 
- Create a phone number in Twilio and point it at your server.com/weathergram/index.xml. 
- Replace the $wunderground_api_key variable with your own key, and try calling the number.
- PROFIT
- Add more songs, since there really aren't enough yet

Demo
---------
For a real life demo, try calling (747) 800-4726 (unless I took the demo down for some reason)
